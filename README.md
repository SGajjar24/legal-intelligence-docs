## 🏛️ What is it?

The **Legal Intelligence Platform** is an enterprise-grade engine designed to solve the "Paperwork Asymmetry" in litigation.

It transforms messy folders of PDFs (Notices, Orders, Appeals) into a **Structured Knowledge Graph**, allowing lawyers to visualize the entire history of a case in seconds.

### ⚡ Key Capabilities

| **Logic Engine** | Logic-based extraction of Dates & Sections (Zero Hallucination). |
| **Timeline View** | Interactive visual graph of the case history. |
